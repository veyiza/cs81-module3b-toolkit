I noticed many patterns among these functions in that they are all almost opposites of eachother function the same but for different things.
The double(n) and multiply(n) functions reflect eachother and serve to perform different forms of math. The same applies to the isEven(n)
and isOdd(n) functions as they reflect eachother and work to tell you if a number is odd or even.

The most challenging part of this for me was learning how to properly input the functions so i could get the correct output. I now understand
much better and have a more clear understanding of how these functions work in the web console.

These functions are used in real websites for functionality within the website like calculating prices. Developers also use this toolkit to 
test and play around so they can add to their bigger projects in the future.
